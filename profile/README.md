## What is PoWNS?

**PoW Name Service (PoWNS)** is a decentralized naming system where domain scarcity is determined by computational work, not money. Unlike ENS where the highest bidder wins, PoWNS lets anyone compete fairly through Proof of Work.

## 🏗️ Project Status

We have completed the core development phase. The codebase is currently frozen for auditing and final debugging before mainnet launch.
